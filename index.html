            The position in which thought finds itself after 1945 forces Hannah Arendt to
            leave the realm of philosophy and turn to literature. Only there does she encounter
            the question preoccupying her. In her “Preface: The Gap Between Past and
            Future,” which precedes the essays of her 1961 volume Between Past and Future,
            the moment in which she moves into a reading of Kafka is rooted in an experience
            that refers to the relation between thought and reality: “reality has become
            opaque for the light of thought.”1 For Arendt, the present Now in which she writes
            and thinks is marked by the fact that thinking and reality are no longer linked
            with one another. Thought does not withstand the shock of reality. Therefore,
            thinking - “no longer bound to incident as the circle remains bound to its focus” -
            risks “either […] becom[ing] altogether meaningless” or relying on truths that
            have been passed down, “old verities which have lost all concrete relevance.”2
            Through the quote from René Char's Feuillets à Hypnos [Leaves of Hypnos] that
            introduces her essay - “Notre héritage n'est précédé d'aucun testament - 'our
            inheritance was left to us by no testament'”3 - Arendt's reflections on the divergence
            of thinking and reality are temporally and logically connected back to the
            time of the resistance and to the realization of the abyss into which the grounds
            of reality, der Boden der Tatsachen, have changed, as she writes in an earlier text.
            So it is the wish to describe this particular situation in exact terms that leads
            Arendt to Kafka. She reads Kafka's text - an account from the series of the “He”
            pieces from 19204 - as a “parable.” In this term, she follows the word's etymological
            traces of meaning (para, next to, and ballein, to throw) and describes the
            text as a kind of missile of rays, which sheds light on the hidden inner structure
            of occurrences. It is precisely in this image that she sees the singularity of Kafka's
            literature. These rays of light, “thrown alongside and around the incident […]
            do not illuminate its outward appearance but possess the power of X rays to lay
            bare its inner structure that, in our case, consists of the hidden processes of the
            mind.”5
            Kafka's text constructs a thought-image in which a man, “he,” is caught
            between two antagonistic forces: “The scene is a battleground on which the
            forces of the past and the future clash with each other; between them we find
            the man whom Kafka calls 'he,'' who, if he wants to stand his ground at all, must
            give battle to both forces.”6 Arendt emphasizes that the time currents of the past
            and the future collide as antagonistic forces only because “he” is already there:
            “the fact that there is a fight at all seems due to the presence of the man.”7 The
            term “presence” here emerges in its spatial connotation. Arendt's commentary
            moves back and forth between “the human being” and the “he,” the pronoun
            that occurs in Kafka's text; this oscillation thereby signals how the contradiction
            between the universal and the singular in her reading is at once opened up and
            settled. “Seen from the viewpoint of man,” she notes, time is not a continuum;
            rather, it is precisely “at the point where 'he' stands,”8 broken or cracked open. In
            the course of Arendt's reading, her formulation of “the point where 'he' stands” -
            in which the place available to “him” has shrunk to an extreme minimum, to a
            point on a line - translates itself into the “standpoint,” addressing the capacity
            of judgment: “'his' standpoint is not the present as we usually understand it but
            rather a gap in time which 'his' constant fighting, 'his' making a stand against
            past and future keeps in existence.”9 Thus, Arendt's interpretation introduces the
            figure of speech of the “ground under one's feet” [Boden unter den Füßen] and
            links it to a reflection on temporality by reading it as an “insertion in time”: “Only
            because man is inserted into time and only to the extent that he stands his ground
            does the flow of indifferent time break up into tenses.”10 For Arendt, it is precisely
            this insertion, this point of rupture in the indifferent flow of time, that marks the
            beginning of a beginning, as she writes with recourse to Augustinus.
            Kafka's “he,” in its third-person singular form, appears as a pronoun that
            designates a person who can jump out of the line of battle only in dreams. In this
            sense, one can claim that the form of grammatical speech in Kafka's text enacts
            the tension, or perhaps even the conflict, between the singular and the universal:
            the “he” in Kafka at once opens and limits generalization; it does not mediate
            between the singular and the universal. Arendt, however, wishes to develop a
            generally valid metaphor for the activity of thinking via her insertion of and commentary
            on Kafka's text. She searches for a metaphor that allows her to think the
            activity of thinking in such a way that it is bound to and remains anchored in the
            present - “rooted in the present.”11 Thus, she is concerned with a thinking that
            remains embedded in “human time”12 and does not surrender to “the old dream
            which Western metaphysics has dreamed from Parmenides to Hegel of a timeless,
            spaceless, suprasensuous realm as the proper region of thought.”13 Arendt brings
            the jump of which Kafka's “he” “at least” dreams, namely, that “some time in an
            unguarded moment - and this would require a night darker than any night has
            ever been yet - he will jump out of the fighting line,”14 into accord with the jump
            that thought makes from human time into the timeless sphere of metaphysics, as
            passed on in the Western history of philosophy.
            For Arendt, Kafka's “he” has barely enough room to stand, because Kafka
            clings to the traditional image that presents time as a straight line.15 She replaces
            the figure of the line with a parallelogram. According to her argument, this form
            comes into being due to the mere fact that the “he” is imprisoned in the flow of
            time: “The insertion of man, as he breaks up the continuum, cannot but cause
            the forces to deflect, however lightly, from their original direction.”16 This tiny
            deflection of powers allows something spatial, an angle, to appear, and so the
            geometric metaphor changes: the line becomes a plane. Or in Arendt's words: the
            interval, the gap where “he” stands, becomes something like a parallelogram of
            forces. Yet what is decisive for the genesis of this metaphor of the activity of thinking,
            which Arendt gleans from her reading of Kafka, is that now the point where
            the forces collide becomes the origin of a third figure: namely, a diagonal line.
            Exactly inverting the two forces that meet in the point, this diagonal force would
            be limited from its point of origin but infinite with regard to its end. The movement
            of thinking expressed in this image would thus have a determined direction
            through past and future, yet at the same time it would not be completable. Arendt
            describes the figure constituted in this way as a “small non-time-space in the very
            heart of time,”17 which cannot be passed on but must be constantly reinvented.
            According to this thought-image, then, it is the activity of thinking itself that
            forges a narrow path of non-time in the time-space of the mortal human.
            Thus, we see that the attempt to open the battlefield outlined by Kafka characterizes
            the direction that Arendt's reading of Kafka takes. However, citing an
            insertion from Kafka's text, Arendt emphasizes that “this is only theoretically
            so”18 - so […] aber nur teoretisch ist.19 According to Arendt, it is more likely that
            “he” - unable to find the diagonal - perishes from fatigue, “aware only of the
            existence of this gap in time which, as long as he lives, is the ground on which
            he must stand, though it seems to be a battlefield and not a home.”20 Moreover,
            Arendt clarifies that her aim is to confront “the contemporary conditions
            of thought” with the help of a metaphor. She emphasizes that her claims apply
            only to mental phenomena, in other words, to thought in time, and cannot be
            transposed to historical or biographical time. But fragments from the ruinous
            landscape of biographical and historical time can be touched and sheltered by
            thought and memory and saved into the (previously noted) “small non-timespace
            in the very heart of time.”
